<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
<UL>
<LI>3 lb pork tenderloin, sliced 3/4" thick 
<LI>3 Tbsp salt-free <A HREF="misc.htm#9">Creole seasoning</A>
<LI>1.5 tsp salt
<LI>3 Tbsp flour
<LI>4 Tbsp butter
<LI>1/2 red bell pepper, sliced lengthwise

<LI>1/4 cup brandy

<LI>1/2 cup late-harvest white wine
<LI>1/2 tsp Tabasco sauce
</UL>
</TABLE>
<P>
Combine seasoning, salt and flour, and coat the pork with the mixture.  Heat half of the butter in a deep skillet over medium/high heat and saute peppers (~ 5 min).  Remove peppers and set aside.  Add the rest of the butter and brown pork (you may have to do this in a couple of batches) on both sides (~8 min).  Remove pork and set aside.  Add brandy to pan let most of it evaporate as you stir to loosen up what ever is stuck at the bottom of the pan.  Add 1/2 cup of water, cloves, peaches, and pork.  Simmer for 20 min, then remove the pork.  Simmer the sauce for an additional 5 min.  Remove the cloves and discard.  Add wine and Tabasco and use a stick blender to process the sauce until smooth.  Add pork and peppers and heat for about 5 min. If sauce is to thick, add some more water.  Serve with cooked rice and a nice white wine.  (8 servings)

<UL>
<LI>1 lb red kidney beans
<LI>1 yellow onion, chopped
<LI>2 Tbsp olive oil
<LI>1/2 lb tasso (major fat removed), cut in bean-sized cubes
<LI>1/2 lb Andouille sausage, sliced lenght-wise then in 1/4-inch half-moons

<P>
Pick through the beans and remove unwanted particles.  Wash beans in water and bring to a boil together with the onion with 2 quarts of water in a large Dutch oven or pot.  Reduce heat, cover, and boil slowly for 1 hr.  With slotted spoon, remove about 2 cups of cooked beans and mash them well with a fork in a bowl.  Heat oil in frying pan over medium-high heat.  Add tasso and sausage and saute for about 5 min.  Transfer tasso and sausage to bowl of mashed beans and remove about a cup of liquid from the large pot and deglaze the pan.  Return liquid, tasso, sausage, mashed beans to the large pot.  Add garlic, parsley, and spices and simmer for about 30 more minutes.  (This is a good time to prepare the rice.)  Serve over cooked rice (and hot sauce on the side) with Chianti or an amber ale.  (8 servings)
