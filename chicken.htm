<LI>4 chicken breasts halves, with skin and ribs
<LI>2 garlic cloves
<LI>3/4 cup black olives, pitted
<LI>1 Tbsp thyme
<LI>2 oz feta cheese
<LI>2 Tbsp olive oil
</UL>
</TABLE>
<P>
With a scarp knife remove ribs (and all bones) from breasts, carefully not to lose any meat. (If the "tenderloin" comes off, save it for later.) Place the rib-free breasts, skin up, on a flat surface. Process garlic in a food processor until minced. Add olives, thyme, feta cheese, and 1 Tbsp olive oil; process just until a paste is formed but not longer since you want to retain texture. 
<BR>
Loosen the skin on each chicken breast to form a pocket with the opening toward the meaty side. Stuff each pocket with 2 Tbsp of paste (and any tenderloin). Rub the remaining paste over the skin. Heat oven broiler. Heat to medium-high the remaining oil in an oven-safe skillet on stove. Add chicken breasts, skin sides down; saut&eacute;, turning once, until golden brown on both sides (4-5 min on each side). (Don't worry if paste sticks to the bottom of skillet.) Keep skin sides up and place skillet 2" under broiler.
<BR>
Broil until chicken skin is crisp (almost burned), about 5 min longer (keep a close watch while you broil). (4 servings)

This is very time consuming soup. Brown the meat in 2 Tblsp butter over medium-high heat, breaking it up into very small pieces. Season with salt and pepper and cook for about 18-20 min. Add the fresh vegetables and spices, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring often, for 20 min. Add the stock, increase the heat to boiling, then reduce to a simmer for 30 min. When the time is almost done, melt the remaining butter in a separate pot over medium heat and add the dry roux, stirring constantly for 3 min. Remove from heat and add liquid from the meat and vegetable pot to the roux, stirring constantly. Continue until your roux has the consistency of sour cream, then add the roux to the bigger pot a little at the time, stirring to avoid lumps. Simmer to about 25 min, stirring to avoid sticking. Add sherry and bring to boil. Add sauces, lemon juice, and tomatoes. Bring to a simmer. Add spinach and eggs and bring to simmer. Remove from heat and serve with buttered toasted (sourdough) bread.
