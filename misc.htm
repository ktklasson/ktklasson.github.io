<LI>1 Tbsp Cayenne pepper
<LI>1 Tbsp dried oregano
<LI>1 Tbsp dried thyme

Mix all ingredients well and store in closed container.  This will make a very good salt-free Creole seasoning.  If the recipe does not call for salt-free, add 1 part of salt for every 4-5 parts of salt-free.

<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><B>Pineapple Habanero Syrup</B></FONT>
<P>
<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
<UL>
<LI>1 8-oz can of crushed pinaapple
<LI>1/2-1 seeded habanero pepper
<LI>1 cup sugar
<LI>1/4 cup water
</UL>
</TABLE>
<P>
Heat all the ingredients in a saucepan over low-medium to a boil. Using a sturdy spoon or something else, press repeatedly the habanero to the bottom of the pan.  Simmer for 5 min and allow to cool. Strain through colander and use the spoon to press through any remaining liquid.  After you remove the habanero pieces (or chop them finely), you can save the pineapple mash for jam that works great with Brie cheese.  (Makes 8 oz. Substitute 0.5 oz of simple sugar with this syrup in your favorite cocktail for a little kick.)
