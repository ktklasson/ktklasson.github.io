Spread a deep layer of coconut flakes in a large plate.  Shape a Tbsp of mix in your hand to a ball.  Roll the ball in the coconut flakes until you have a nice coating.

If you can not find the vanilla sugar, you can substitute with vanilla extract (1 tsp)just remember to reduce the other liquid amount to just under 2 Tbsp. (20-22 balls)

Invest in a digital kitchen thermometer for baking. Use a mortar and pestle for fine grinding.  Carefully microwave the milk, butter, and 1/2 tsp of sugar until butter is melted and the temperature of the mixture is 100-110&deg.  Stir in the yeast and let it stand for 5 min. Mix in 2 Tbsp of the egg. Mix and carefully microwave flour, remaining sugar, salt, and cardamom mixture until 100-110&degF. In a bowl, mix dry and wet ingredients. Mix and knead for 4-5 minutes, adding additional flour until dough is smooth, sticky, but not sticking. Cover with plastic wrap, place in cold oven with digital thermometer, and turn on oven for 20-30 seconds. The target is to warm oven to 100-110&degF.   Allow dough to rise and double in size (40-60 min).  Remove from oven onto a floured surface. Knead dough for 5 sec. and divide into six pieces. Roll each piece between your hands to form a ball and place on parchment-covered baking sheet.  Cover with moist kitchen towel and placed in the warm oven.  Allow to rise to double in size (25-30 min).  Remove from oven and heat oven to 400&degF.  Brush rolls with the remaining egg mixed with 1/2 Tbsp water.  Bake for 15-20 min.  Let cool on wire rack under moist kitchen towel (30-40 min).  Freeze buns you will not use.  Slice off about 1/4 off the top of the bun (set top aside).  Use a small fork and remove the internal part of the bun (2" diam., 1/2" deep) and save the crumbs. Mix crumbs with almond paste and milk (~1 oz almond paste and 1/2 Tbsp milk per two buns) to a smooth thick paste. Fill the hollowed out part of the bun with the paste, top with whipped cream, and place the saved bun top on top of the cream. Sprinke the top with the powdered sugar.  Serve immediately with coffee.  (Do not fill and decorate more buns than what you will eat in a sitting.)

Invest in a digital kitchen thermometer for baking. Carefully microwave the half-and-half and 1/2 tsp of sugar until the temperature of the mixture is 100-110&deg.  Stir in the yeast and let it stand for 5 min. Mix in the egg and remaining sugar. Carefully microwave flour and butter until 100-110&degF. Use the tips of your fingers to pinch and blend in the butter into the flour until you have a crumbly mixture. Add the yeast and egg mixture.

Cover with plastic wrap, place in cold oven with digital thermometer, and turn on oven for 20-30 seconds at a time. The target is to warm oven to 100-110&degF. Allow dough to rise and double in size (30 min) together with a small bowl containing filling ingredients.  Remove from oven and kneed dough for 30 sec.  Place on a floured surface and press and strech until you have a rectange 18"x10". Spread the fillings on 2/3 of rectangle (12"x10").  Fold the 1/3 unfilled part over onto 1/2 of the filled part.  Then fold over the exposed 1/3 filled part onto the other parts.  You will now have a 3-layer rectange 6"x10".  Slice into ten 6"x1" strips.  Stretch each strip sligtly, twist and roll, tucking the end under.  Place in paper muffin cups.  Cover with moist kitchen towel and placed in the warm oven.

<P>
This is a time-consuming activity.  (To create and maintain a starter, see <A HREF="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe">link</A>. Once we have a starter, we keep it (about 1/2 cup) in the fridge.) Remove starter from fridge and feed it 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup of water, and 1/2 Tbsp instant milk powder.  Wait until the starter is bubbly and has doubled is size (6 hrs).  Mix 1/2 cup of water, the milk powder, and salt in microwavable container.  Place 1/4 cup of water and sugar in a second microwavable container.  Microwave the two containers for about 20 sec until 100-110&degF. Add the yeast to the 1/4 cup of water.  Stir both containers.  Wait 5 min.  Microwave flour for about 20 sec until 100-110&degF. Place flour in a bowl and make a deep hole.  Add starter and both water mixtures to hole.  Stir the liquid, incorporating more and more flour from the sides until it is all blended together. Knead and add more flour as needed until the dough is smooth and sticky but not sticking.  Cover the bowl and place in warm (100&degF) oven until double is size (45 min).  Punch down the dough and knead, add more flour as needed.  Make a round ball, cover with moist towel, and place on parchment-paper-covered baking sheet.  Place in warm oven for 30 min.  Remove from oven and heat oven to 425&degF. Bake for 25-30 min.
